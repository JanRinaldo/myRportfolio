# myRportfolio
Initial implementation to handle a small portfolio of equities and ETFs with R

Based on various R packages it makes use of the powerful TradeAnalytics suite 
and uses the blotter package to keep track of the trading history.
Besides the possibility to easily create a portfolio in blotter it also
offers basic calculations on the portfolio to give you a quick overview on the
current positions.
This is not really a tool to really implement a portfolio management strategy, but it 
rather is a tool to keep track of the changes in a personal portfolio and get a quick
overview over the current positions.
